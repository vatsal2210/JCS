                    <p>
                        Jain Community Services (JCS) of Canada marked a momentous
                        occasion on Saturday, May 3rd, 2025, by hosting a vibrant
                        in-person event at the Jain Society of Toronto (JSOT), Moti
                        Champsee Cultural Centre, bringing together over 100 members
                        of the Jain community for a morning of celebration, learning,
                        and connection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The highlight of the event was presenting the Lifetime
                        Achievement Award to Manharbhai and Sunitaben Sheth, in
                        recognition of their extraordinary 40 years of humanitarian
                        service to the Jain community in Canada. The award was a
                        heartfelt tribute to their lifelong dedication to Jain values,
                        community building, and service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i>"This honor is not just a reflection of our personal
                            journey, but a tribute to the spirit of seva, unity, and
                            resilience that defines our community."</i>
                        noted the couple in their acceptance message. They believe
                        deeply in <i>Parasparopagraho Jivanam</i> — that all life is
                        bound together by mutual support and interdependence.
                    </p>
                    <p>In addition to the award ceremony, JCS Canada hosted a well-received Career Guidance
                        &amp; Mentorship
                        session, designed to help youth and professionals alike gain valuable insights into
                        their personal and
                        professional development.</p>
                    <p>An outstanding lineup of professionals and hiring managers from various industries
                        generously shared
                        their journeys, challenges, and lessons learned. The session fostered meaningful
                        conversations and
                        inspired attendees to take confident steps forward — while remaining grounded in the
                        values of service
                        and community.</p>
                    <p>Another key highlight of the day was the official launch of the new JCS Canada website,
                        <a href="http://jcscanada.org" target="_blank">www.jcscanada.org</a>. This digital
                        platform is set to serve as a comprehensive resource for Jain community
                        members across Canada, offering information on services, programs, and opportunities for
                        involvement.
                    </p>
                    <p>To close the event, attendees enjoyed a delicious Jain meal prepared by the JSOT Kitchen
                        Team, whose
                        culinary efforts reflected the community's emphasis on purity, hospitality, and shared
                        joy.</p>
                    <p>The event was made possible by the dedicated efforts of the Jain Community Services (JCS)
                        Board
                        Members, Sheth family members, volunteers, and supporters. The generous support and use
                        of the hall
                        and facilities provided by Jain Society of Toronto (JSOT) played a key role in the
                        event's success. "It was
                        inspiring to see so many generations come together — from young professionals to senior
                        community
                        leaders — all committed to strengthening the fabric of our community," said a
                        participant.</p>
                    <p>With a blend of reflection, recognition, and forward-looking dialogue, the May 3rd event
                        was a true
                        celebration of the Jain ethos — fostering unity, knowledge, and service across
                        generations.</p>
                    <p><i>Due to space limitations, we were only able to accommodate only 100 attendees, and
                            regretfully, many
                            Jain community members and well wishers could not be included.</i></p>
