# Jain Community Services of Canada Hosts Milestone Event

Jain Community Services (JCS) of Canada marked a momentous occasion on Saturday, May 3rd, 2025, by hosting a vibrant in-person event at the Jain Society of Toronto (JSOT), Moti Champsee Cultural Centre, bringing together over 100 members of the Jain community for a morning of celebration, learning, and connection.

## Lifetime Achievement Award

The highlight of the event was presenting the Lifetime Achievement Award to Manharbhai and Sunitaben Sheth, in recognition of their extraordinary 40 years of humanitarian service to the Jain community in Canada. The award was a heartfelt tribute to their lifelong dedication to Jain values, community building, and service.

> "This honor is not just a reflection of our personal journey, but a tribute to the spirit of seva, unity, and resilience that defines our community." - Manharbhai and Sunitaben Sheth
